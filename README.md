# DV2546 Software Security Laboratory Assignments
This repository contains the solutions and documentation for Laboratory Assignments 2 and 3 of the DV2546 Software Security course at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

# Assignment 2: Bugpop3 Exploitation
# Task 1: Exploiting Buffer Overflow to Read Emails
+ Identified vulnerabilities in the bugpop3 service.
+ Demonstrated how to access sensitive information (Bob's email) by exploiting buffer overflow.
+ Provided prevention measures including limiting buffer size and using safer programming languages.

# Task 2: Preventing Email Access for Bob
+ Utilized a vulnerability in the code to lock access for Bob to read emails.
+ Demonstrated the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve the task.

# Task 3: Permanent Logout for Alice and Bob
+ Leveraged symlink vulnerability to create a permanent logout scenario for Alice and Bob.
+ Implemented a technique to prevent users from logging in without resource exhaustion.


# Assignment 3: Buffer Overflow Exploitation
# Task 1: Exploiting Buffer Overflow in Binary "oflow"
+ Detailed steps to exploit buffer overflow vulnerability in the "oflow" binary.
+ Used techniques like finding function addresses, lldb debugging, and Python scripting to reveal secrets.

# Task 2: Exploiting Buffer Overflow with printf Vulnerability
+ Explored vulnerabilities in object code, specifically with printf.
+ Demonstrated the process of creating assembly code, translating it to binary, and utilizing it to reveal process ids.
+ Each assignment includes a comprehensive README with step-by-step instructions, vulnerability analysis, exploitation techniques, and prevention measures. Explore the individual directories for detailed documentation and code implementations.
